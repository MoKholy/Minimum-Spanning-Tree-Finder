Welcome to my MINIMUM SPANNING TREE UTILITY

This utility allows you to find the minimum spanning tree of a graph, generate random graphs or even compare the running time of different algorithms for finding minimum spanning trees.

You can select 3 options:
1. Generate a graph, You will then be able to find the minimum spanning tree of the generated graph and storing it in a new file called output.txt.
2. Compare running time, this compares the running time of prim's and kruskal's algorithms for finding minimum spanning trees for graphs of sizes 30 to 99 inclusive.
3. Read Graph from file, Name the file graph.txt and then you will be able to find the minimum spanning tree of that graph and even store the data in a new file called output.txt.
